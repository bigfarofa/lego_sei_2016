## Warning: This project was made in 2016 during 11th grade in Portugal with partnership of a friend. It has been 5 years(uploading this in 2021), so I don't recall everything about the code. It does not follow best practices and it's here for preservation purposes only.

## About
This repository contains scripts for the Lego Mindstorms. They have many purposes, but the main goal of this project was to make a robot that could follow coloured lines. The specific script for this can be found in `Projeto/TwoSensorV3.sb`.


## File structure

- `Projeto` : Holds the final scripts to operate the LEGO Mindstorm. `TwoSensorV3` is the final script. The other files are for previous iterations or just for testing.
- `seguir`: Scripts to follow a white line
- `seguir cores`: Scripts to follow coloured lines
- `exp*.sb`: Exercise files requested by a tutor.
- `seguir_v2.sb`: Script that follows two colours
- `tests.sb`: Random tests
